            <h2>Historical Origins of Technology in Africa</h2>
            <p>This chapter chronicles Africa’s rich yet overlooked history of science and technology to overturn dominant stereotypes of pre-colonial primitiveness and postcolonial backwardness. It documents how diverse African civilisations independently developed sophisticated innovations and knowledge systems before colonialism, including advanced metallurgy, architecture, textiles, tools, medicine, and trade networks adapted to indigenous needs. </p>
